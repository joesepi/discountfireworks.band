Electronic Press Kit for Discount Fireworks

## Bio
Discount Fireworks is an exercise in auditory interdependence. Jeff Maleri (bass) and Bryce Jeffcoat (drums) resuscitate and evolve melodies that have long haunted Joe Sepi. Sepi offers heart on his sleeve vocals and a signature post-punk, no wave guitar sensibility. Maleri’s bass stylings are soulful, blues-infused and entrancing. Jeffcoat’s hardcore-laced percussion tethers his bandmates. What emerges is a trio who effortlessly travel time signatures and invite negative space. What emerges is a kind of humble, cerebral rock.
